# Examination-Registration-Cell

  Exam cell automation consists of activities such as allocating students to their particular exam hall, preparing exam schedules and allocating blocks according to their availability. These calculations which are currently being done are paper-based and involve a lot of cumbersome efforts by hand. An alternative solution to this is a software-based exam automation cell application which does the work of allocating students to their exam blocks and helps the admin to store the marls in the database and calculate percentage etc based on it. The objective of the whole application is to ease human efforts by automating this entire task.
